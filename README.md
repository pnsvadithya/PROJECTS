1)REAL-TIME FACE ATTENDANCE SYSTEM
 Incorporating cutting-edge facial recognition technologies, the proposed "Real-Time Face 
Attendance" system stands as a significant leap in attendance management. By harnessing the 
capabilities of FaceNet and HaarCascadeClassifier models, the system ensures swift and precise 
attendance recording through real-time face detection. A standout feature is the one-shot learning 
ability, streamlining training with just a single photo per individualâ€”perfect for utilizing 
passport-size photos. This approach enhances adaptability across diverse environments, offering 
a contactless and efficient attendance management solution. The proposed system seeks to 
revolutionize traditional attendance practices, addressing manual tracking challenges and 
providing a user-friendly and accurate alternative for educational institutions, corporate settings, 
and public facilities.
